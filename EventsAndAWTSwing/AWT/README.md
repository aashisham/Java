# AWT ( abstract window toolkit)
  - AWT contains large numbers of classes and methods that allows you to create and manage graphical user interface(GUI) such as windows, buttons, scrollbars,textblocks ,etc.
  - The awt was designed to provide a common set of tools for GUI design that could work on a variety of platforms.
  - The tools provided by the awt are implemented using each platforms native GUI toolkit, hence preserving the look and feel of each platform. It is an advantage of awt. But the disadvantage of such an approach is that GUI designed on one platform may look different when displayed on another platform.
  - Awt is the foundation upon which swing is made.
